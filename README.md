# Rajasthan_Hackathon
Code base for Challenge for Change online hackathon organised by govt. of Rajasthan.

# Our Hack:
# LandChain App 
It is a decentralised land registry application based on the Ethereum Blockchain.
Since records made in the Blockchain are immutable ie the records cannot be tempered with
thus establishing trust in the field.

# Working
After a land is being bought or sold the government adds the information to the Blockchain.
Any user can search for a particular Land and get the details of the Land and its associated Owner.


# Implementation
1. WebApp: The website can be acceseed by the Government as well as the public.
a. The Government (only) will have access to the Admin Page and will add the records of Land and the associated Owner to the Blockchain.
b. The Public (anyone) can access the Lookup Page and can lookup the information of a Land and its associated Owner.
2. Android App: The Public (anyone) can download the android app and can search the history of a Land and its associated Owner details.

# Problems solved with our Hack
In India, there are significant number of frauds happenning everyday associated with the Land Buying and Selling.
With this system, anyone who wants to buy a Land can Lookup the information about the Land an its Actual Owner on the App whose datas are fully Authentic that are only added by the Government, thus preventing frauds.
Thus a platform is made which can be used to get datas which are fully authentic.
